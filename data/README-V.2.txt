# Markdown â†’ HTML Converter

## Overview
This module provides a reliable pipeline to convert Markdown (`.md`) files into branded HTML pages for the Malone Global University (MGU) ecosystem.  

It powers the **dev-blog**, changelogs, journals, and other Markdown-based documentation, ensuring that every record is published with consistency, auditability, and transparency.
