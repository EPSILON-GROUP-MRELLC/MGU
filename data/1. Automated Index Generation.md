1. Automated Index Generation

Purpose: Every directory gets its own index.html or index.md auto-generated with links to subfiles/folders.

Implementation:

Use a Node.js or Python script to walk the directory structure (os.walk() in Python, fs.readdir in Node).

Generate index.md for docs or index.html for public-facing pages.

Can be run manually or on a Git post-commit hook.

Example (Python concept):

import os

def make_index(path):
    files = os.listdir(path)
    with open(os.path.join(path, 'index.html'), 'w') as f:
        f.write("<ul>\n")
        for file in files:
            if file != 'index.html':
                f.write(f'<li><a href="{file}">{file}</a></li>\n')
        f.write("</ul>")

for root, dirs, _ in os.walk('.'):
    make_index(root)

2. Version Control & Change Tracking

Git-based â€” you already push to Netlify, so:

Commit messages serve as a change ledger.

You can extract commit history into a Mozilla-style public change log.

Optional: Maintain a site_version.json in /data/version/ that updates automatically with each commit, including:

{
  "version": "2025.08.14",
  "last_updated": "2025-08-14T15:32:00Z",
  "changes": "Updated library documentation, removed deprecated folders"
}

3. Change Documentation

For human-readable records, adopt a CHANGELOG.md standard.
Example format:

## [2025-08-14]
- Removed unused folders (temp, crap, New folder)
- Updated library encyclopedia structure
- Prepared for automated index generation


Store this at /docs/CHANGELOG.md and link it from your home page.

4. Deployment Integration

Tie automation to Netlify build hooks so that:

You push changes to Git.

The index generator runs.

CHANGELOG.md and site_version.json update.

Netlify deploys automatically.

If you want, I can write you a unified Python script that:

Scans all folders

Generates indexes

Updates version file

Appends to a master changelog

That way, every time you run it, your site gets an instant navigation update and version tag before push.
