      <p>
        MD301 elevates the Strategist to the Commander tier—where vision becomes structure, and decisions shape generations. This course is about executive mastery over systems. You will learn to manage companies, states, and entire ecosystems with the discipline of a sovereign CEO: enforcing order, optimizing resources, and institutionalizing excellence.
