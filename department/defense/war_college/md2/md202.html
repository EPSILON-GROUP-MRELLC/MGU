      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MD202 is the confrontation course. It dissects the global Old Guard—corporate oligarchs, academic frauds, and post-colonial bureaucracies—and contrasts them with the Malone Doctrine’s framework for just power, economic sovereignty, and incorruptible leadership. This course prepares the Strategist to dismantle outdated models and construct new paradigms built on truth, merit, and systemic integrity.

        <li><strong>Media, Narrative, and Memory</strong><br />
