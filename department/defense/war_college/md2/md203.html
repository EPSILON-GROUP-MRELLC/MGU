      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MD203 trains the Strategist in modern psychological combat—where war is waged not with bullets, but with perception, story, and mass manipulation. This course covers the doctrine of information warfare, cultural infiltration, media control, and ideological dominance. You will learn how regimes rise or fall based not on armies, but on the control of meaning itself.
