      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MD302 teaches the moral backbone of command: the relationship between justice and power. As a leader of civilizations, your rule must be ethical, enforceable, and respected. This course explores internal justice systems—how to define fairness, uphold loyalty, and apply sanctions without tyranny or hypocrisy. It trains you to build trust through discipline, not sentiment.
