    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <p>
      MD303 teaches how to dominate the global chessboard through sovereign strength, strategic presence, and principled diplomacy. You'll learn how to maneuver across world systems with discipline, outlasting alliances, and commanding fear-respect without sacrificing your code. This is foreign policy for the autocrat who bends to no bloc, yet shapes them all.
